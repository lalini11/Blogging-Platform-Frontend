# 📝 Blogging Platform – Frontend (ReactJS + Bootstrap + CKEditor)

This is the frontend repository of a full-stack blogging platform. It allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their blog posts. The app uses **ReactJS**, **Bootstrap**, and **CKEditor** for rich content editing.

## 🧠 My Approach

- Separated pages (Home, Dashboard, Auth, etc.) for better routing structure
- Used Axios interceptor to attach JWT token automatically
- Implemented conditional navigation and access control based on login status
- Stored tokens in localStorage for persistent sessions
- CKEditor used to improve the post creation/editing experience
